## 📜 Description
Rice Disease Prediction is an Android application that leverages deep learning techniques to detect diseases in paddy leaves. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and TensorFlow Lite for real-time disease detection, helping farmers take preventive measures at no cost.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Uses **CNN architecture** for accurate disease detection.
- ✅ Integrated **TensorFlow Lite API** for model inference on Android.
- ✅ Accepts image input in **.jpg format** from both **camera and gallery**.
- ✅ Provides **real-time recommendations** for detected diseases.
- ✅ Aims to assist farmers in **early disease identification** and **crop management**.
